		I think when it comes to copy right issues, there should be a lot of restrictions because people could make money off of something someone else would have made. Such as music, people thinkg if you add music it wont change anything because it on a low level and can't really hear it. But still can attrach viewers and get them some more money. This would cause people to get money from other people and not give the person who made the music any profit.
